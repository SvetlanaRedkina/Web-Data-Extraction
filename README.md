# Web Data Extraction

If you, like me, love working with data, then you might be interested about 👀 how to extract data for Analysis in an efficient and fast way.

With the help of web scraping, you can extract data from a website, no matter how large the data is on your computer 💻. 

For this project, I use Python's 🐍 Scrapy.

There are currently two folders in the repo:

## 1. Chewy 🐶 😹

In the dogs_food.py file, you can see that DogsFoodSpider(CrawlSpider) scrapes the information from Chewy.com about dogs' wet food.

The scraped data is stored into the Wet_Dog_Food.csv.

I can use the data to analyze price-quality relationships of the scraped items. 

The end goal is to find the best food for my wonderful dog Yuna 🐕.

## 2. Indeed 👷

In the jobs_ny.py file, you will find a class called JobsNySpider(scrapy.Spider) that scrapes data from Indeed.com.

I am interested in gathering information about Analytics' job postings.

Job location: New York, NY.

The scraped data is stored into the Analytics_Jobs_NY_Indeed.csv.

I will use the data I have collected to explore the Analytics' job market in NY 📈.
